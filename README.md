# Business Problem:
  The business problem is to predict future sales for a product or service-based business based on various factors such as 
advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform. Accurate sales prediction is crucial for 
businesses to optimize their marketing strategies, allocate resources effectively, and make informed decisions to maximize
